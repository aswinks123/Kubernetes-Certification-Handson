#nodePort service

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nodeport-service   #Name of the service
spec: 
  type: NodePort #It will open a port on all the nodes
  selector:
    app: backend   #Service uses this selector to identify the backend pods that are to be added as endpoints.
  ports:
    - port: 8081  #Port where ther service listen to. Clients inside the cluster can access this port
      targetPort: 80 #Port where the service route the traffic to. ie, pods are listening to the mentioned port.

#Learnings
#If you did not specify the nodeport IP manually, it will automatically assign an IP from the range(30000â€“32767)
#Nodeport allows the user to connect to the service through the node port( port that is opened on all nodes)
#When a request reaches the node port, it will be routed to the service and then there by routed to the backend pods
#Drawback: Users have to manually type the port along with the nodeIP. also there will be multiple node IP that all exposes the same node port.

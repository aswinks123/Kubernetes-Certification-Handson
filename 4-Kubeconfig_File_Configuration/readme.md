## What is a kubeconfig file?

Itâ€™s a YAML file used by kubectl and other Kubernetes clients.

It contains information about clusters, users, and contexts so you can connect and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters.

By default, kubectl looks for it at


```go
~/.kube/config
```

You can also specify another file with:


```go
kubectl --kubeconfig=/path/to/file
```

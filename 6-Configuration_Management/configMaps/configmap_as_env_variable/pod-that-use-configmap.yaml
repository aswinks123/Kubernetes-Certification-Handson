#Learnings
#Instead of mounting a ConfigMap as files, you can inject its key-value pairs directly into the containerâ€™s environment variables.
#This will add teh config map value as an environment variable inside the pod.
#Important: When config map is modified, the env will not automatically update instide the pod. You must restart/recreate the Pod to update the env.

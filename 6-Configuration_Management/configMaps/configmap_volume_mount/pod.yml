#Learnings
#A volume mount allows you to bring that ConfigMap into your Podâ€™s filesystem.
#Each key becomes a file, and the value is the content of that file.
#When both files are applied, the config map will be injected to the pod as a volume mount at /etc/config
#The key of the configmap will become a file, and value of config map will become the content of that file.
#when the config map is modified and reapplied, it will automatically update the file. No need to restart the pod
